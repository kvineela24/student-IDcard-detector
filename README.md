# student-IDcard-detector
🔭 I’m currently working on a Student ID Card Detection System

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- OCR techniques using Tesseract  
- Image preprocessing with OpenCV  
- Student data validation workflows  
- Automating attendance and ID verification systems  

💬 Ask me about:
- Image processing with Python  
- OCR and text extraction from images  
- Real-time camera-based ID recognition  
- Automating data entry and student authentication systems  

📌 **Features:**
- Automatically detects student ID cards from images or webcam input  
- Extracts student name, ID number, and other relevant details  
- Validates data against a database or student records  
- Can be used for attendance, access control, or exam verification  

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- OCR  
- Firebase for student data storage  

🎯 Making student identification smarter, faster, and more secure!
